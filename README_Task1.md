# Heart Disease

**Analysis of cardiovascular health indicators using classification algorithms for patient diagnosis.**

## Introduction

The dataset under examination is a classic resource used in medical diagnostics, particularly for predicting heart disease. Originating from a collection of databases compiled in 1988, this dataset includes records from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It features a total of 76 attributes, with 14 key attributes commonly used for analysis and prediction. The goal is to utilize various machine learning and statistical techniques to classify patients based on their attributes and assess the effectiveness of different methods in predicting heart disease.

## Libraries Used

1. **NumPy:**  
   A library for numerical operations and array manipulation, commonly used for scientific and engineering calculations.

2. **Pandas:**  
   A data manipulation and analysis tool, especially for structured data, providing data structures like DataFrames.

3. **Matplotlib:**  
   A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

4. **Seaborn:**  
   A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative graphics.

5. **Scikit-learn:**  
   A comprehensive library for data science and machine learning, offering tools for model selection, training, and evaluation.
   - **GaussianNB:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, used for classification tasks.
   - **Logistic Regression:** A model used for binary classification based on logistic functions.
   - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):** A classification technique that improves class separation.
   - **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA):** A classification technique that estimates class-specific probability distributions, allowing for different variances between classes.
